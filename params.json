{"name":"Mansoor Khurshid","tagline":"","body":"### About Me\r\nI am a PhD student at the Department of Aeronautical and Vehicle Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. The focus of my research is design of welded structures. I have analyzed the strength of both arc and friction stir welded joints in Aluminium and High Strength Steel. The main objectives of my work include numerical and experimental assessment of static and fatigue strength of welded joints  subjected to uni-axial and multi-axial stress states. The outcomes of my work have been published in various scientific journals and international conferences. \r\n\r\n### Journal Publications:\r\n1)  M. Khurshid, Z. Barsoum and N.A.
